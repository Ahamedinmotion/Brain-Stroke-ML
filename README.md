🧠 Brain Stroke Prediction Using Deep Learning
🔬 AI-powered stroke detection from MRI scans using CNNs, TensorFlow, Flask, and Python.

🚀 Project Overview
This project uses Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) to predict stroke presence from MRI scans. By analyzing medical imaging, this model enhances early detection, potentially saving lives.

✅ Built With:

Python (for model development)
TensorFlow/Keras (to train and optimize CNNs)
Flask (to integrate the model into a web app)
HTML/CSS (for a user-friendly UI)
Werkzeug (for secure file uploads)
🚀 Key Features:
✔️ MRI Image Analysis with CNNs
✔️ Web-based Prediction System using Flask
✔️ Fast & Accurate Stroke Detection
✔️ Open-source for Healthcare AI Research

⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ Upload an MRI Scan.
2️⃣ The image is preprocessed and passed to the Deep Learning Model.
3️⃣ The model predicts stroke probability and displays the result.

🖥️ Tech Stack:

🏗️ Deep Learning Model: CNNs with TensorFlow
📊 Dataset: Public stroke MRI datasets
🌐 Web Interface: Flask, HTML, CSS
🔄 Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization
